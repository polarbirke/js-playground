A safe place to mess around with "shiny new hotness" like Yarn, Webpack 2, ES2015, etc.

## Getting started

If you want to try out Yarn, you may need to install it first. Follow the instructions on https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install depending on your setup!
 If you'd rather stay with `npm`, you can simply replace all "yarn …" commands with "npm …" commands. 

```sh
yarn install
yarn run build
```

## Develop
### (re-)build bundled JS

```sh
yarn run build
```

### Run unit tests

```sh
yarn run test
```
